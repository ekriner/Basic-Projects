# Basic-Projects
Finished projects as I work through the #100DaysofCode challenge

Day 1: Band Name Generator - Simple variable creation and string manipulation to take inputs and produce outputs from them. Generates a "band name" from given information.

Day 2: Tip Calculator - Uses equations, f-strings, and formatting to gather data about a bill at a restaurant and return the amount owed per person splitting the bill.

Day 3: Treasure Island - Uses if/then statements and conditionals for a simple text-based adventure game. Also utilizes basic string formatting and the loop function.
