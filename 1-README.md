# Basic-Projects
Finished projects as I work through the #100DaysofCode challenge

Day 1: Band Name Generator - Simple variable creation and string manipulation to take inputs and produce outputs from them. Generates a "band name" from given information.

Day 2: Tip Calculator - Uses equations, f-strings, and formatting to gather data about a bill at a restaurant and return the amount owed per person splitting the bill.

Day 3: Treasure Island - Uses if/then statements and conditionals for a simple text-based adventure game. Also utilizes basic string formatting and the loop function.

Day 4: Rock, Paper, Scissors - Uses if/then statements and basic list creation/indexing as well as randomization to create a simple game with the computer. It will loop and keep track of wins and losses as it continues.
